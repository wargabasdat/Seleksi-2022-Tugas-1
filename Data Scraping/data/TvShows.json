Despite a best-laid succession plan, tempers flare over Logan's intentions. Kendall Roy, Logan's eldest son from his second marriage and a division president at the firm, is the heir apparent. As Kendall attempts to solidify his eventual takeover, he and the three other Roy children face a difficult choice as company control and family loyalties collide.",

        "synopsis": "This U.S. adaptation -- set at a paper company based in Scranton, Pa. -- has a similar documentary style to that of the Ricky Gervais-led British original. It features the Dunder-Mifflin staff, which includes characters based on roles in the British show -- and, quite possibly, people with whom you work in your office. There's Jim, the likable employee who's a bit of an every man. Jim has a thing for receptionist-turned-sales-rep Pam -- because office romances are always a good idea! There's also Dwight, the co-worker who is successful but devoid of social skills and common sense.",

For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer's soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul.",

Outwardly, Underwood accepts his marching orders, but secretly he and his wife Claire, an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Walker and his allies. As the series progresses, Underwood ascends through the ranks of the government -- until his death, at which point Claire gains power. Based on the U.K. miniseries of the same name, the U.S. version offers a look behind the scenes at the greed and corruption in American politics.

Kiernan Shipka (\"Mad Men\") leads the cast in the titular role of the show that is based on a comic series of the same name.",

But the charismatic, single-minded Lister -- who dresses head-to-toe in black and charms her way into high society -- has no intention of marrying a man. \"Gentleman Jack\" examines Lister's relationships with her family, servants, tenants and industrial rivals, and would-be wife. The real-life Anne Lister's story was recorded in her diaries, and the most intimate details of her life are revealed for the series.",

Both men use their intelligence, power and influence to outmaneuver the other in this battle over billions.

Accompanied by Peggy Scott, an aspiring writer seeking a fresh start, Marian inadvertently becomes enmeshed in a social war between one of her aunts, a scion of the old money set, and her stupendously rich neighbors, a ruthless railroad tycoon and his ambitious wife, George and Bertha Russell.

For her, he's a welcome escape; for him, she's a pretty distraction. But, the tryst eventually ends two marriages -- one that was already a bit shaky, the other that was on solid ground.",

Each one seems to have only casual relationships (hence the show's title): Valerie because she's newly divorced and trying to have fun; Alex because he's sort of a stereotypical bachelor who has yet to really grow up; and Laura, because she's a teenager. But the new living arrangement turns out to be a learning experience for everyone, punctuated, of course, by typical show devices (blind dates, one-night stands, parental visits, etc.) that lead to moments of hilarity, in between which nuggets of truth can be found.",

His father urges him to buckle down and improve his grades (\"a C is a Jewish F!\" he tells his son, just before collapsing on the tennis court) so he can get into the college's CPA program. Trouble is, David isn't sure he wants to be a CPA. His boss recommends ditching college to go into the stock market. And on a personal level, though David is dating the hot aerobics instructor at the club, his eye wanders to the daughter of one of the club's tougher members (Getty, played by the normally likeable Paul Reiser), who refuses to shake the hands of any of the staff members. Summer won't last forever, though, and David has some decisions to make as he eventually moves on to the Big Apple.",

He's Paul Spector, a father and a husband leading a double life, as viewers learn from the outset.

But the legitimacy of his confessions were eventually questioned. Attorneys and journalists found impossibilities in Lucas' timeline, while DNA testing began to contradict his claims, which received media attention worldwide. This docuseries explores how Lucas -- once called America's most prolific serial killer -- was actually a complex figure entangled in a flawed justice system.",

But after the resourceful prisoner escapes from a maximum-security facility, then is nabbed once again by Burke, Caffrey suggests a different end-game: In return for freedom, he'll help the Feds catch long-sought criminals. Though skeptical, Burke soon realizes that Caffrey's instincts and insight are a rare commodity. Caffrey's trusted friend and co-conspirator with ties to the criminal underworld, Mozzie, also becomes a useful source for Burke and the FBI.",

They're not sure what they want, or who they want it from, and the picture isn't getting any clearer. Hannah thinks she has what it takes to be a successful writer, if only she would write something. She wants a boyfriend without dealing with an actual relationship, and she wants a job without having to work. Marnie is Hannah's best friend, a Type A personality who has a serious boyfriend and an actual job. Jessa is a devil-may-care bohemian whose apparent lack of fear hides her own kind of insecurity. Her cousin, Shoshanna, is an NYU student who would love nothing more than to experience a \"Sex and the City\" lifestyle. The others tend to underestimate Shoshanna, but she proves to be a sharp source of wisdom.",

A never-before-seen ritualistic killer is responsible for the gruesome murders of boy prostitutes, and newly appointed police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt calls upon criminal psychologist Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, newspaper illustrator John Moore and police department secretary Sara Howard to conduct the investigation in secret. The brilliant, obsessive Kreizler is known as an alienist -- one who studies mental pathologies and the deviant behaviors of those who are alienated from themselves and society. His job, along with his controversial views, makes him a social pariah in some circles. But helped by a band of outsiders, Kreizler's tireless efforts eventually answer the question behind what makes a man into a murderer.",

Left in the hands of creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (\"Shanghai Noon,\" \"Smallville\"), the series stars Daniel Wu as ruthless, prodigiously skilled warrior Sunny, who mentors teenage boy M.K. during a spiritual journey across a feudal civilization known as the Badlands. With the help of trained assassins like Sunny, the area is ruled by rival barons, and for decades Quinn has consistently outflanked and outmaneuvered his fellow barons to keep the upper hand. His invincibility, however, begins to fade in light of brazen attacks by the newest baron, The Widow, who believes M.K. is the key to her success. As the battle for control of the Badlands heats up, the destinies of the stoic assassin and the impetuous teenager become intertwined.",

The students are faced with a landscape of cultural bias, social injustice, misguided activism and slippery politics.

Their research shoots them to fame on a trajectory that takes them from humble beginnings in the Midwest to the cover of Time magazine. Masters is a brilliant scientist who is out of touch with his own feelings. Johnson is a divorced mother who is ahead of her time on many fronts, including her determination to have a meaningful career. The pair's relationship isn't just professional, as it evolves into a three-way \"marriage\" with Masters' wife, Libby. \"Masters of Sex\" is based on Thomas Maier's book of the same name, which profiled the pair.",

So it's a good thing he can rely on help from Fiona, his ex-girlfriend and IRA spy, and his friend Sam, also a former spy. Then there's Madeline, Michael's mother, a hypochondriac but probably not a spy.",

As members of society's upper echelons and those on the marginalized fringes begin to question the so-called faultless rules of their reality, perfection gets flipped on its head. Based on Aldous Huxley's prophetic 1932 novel, this genre-bending, science-fiction and fantasy drama imagines a world steeped in holographic pleasure, with hedonistic values re-branded as selflessness for the good of the collective. In a pressure cooker of norms both strait-jacketed and freewheeling, humanity is on a collision course with forbidden love and revolutionary uprising.",

And if Yossarian tries to make an attempt to avoid his assignments, he will be in violation of catch-22, a bureaucratic rule that states a man is considered insane if he willing continues to fly dangerous missions, but a request to be removed from duty is evidence of sanity and makes him ineligible to be relieved of his duty.

While their friends and acquaintances move on to find success and love, they continue to struggle with careers and relationships, getting more bitter by the day. By day, Julie's a TV blogger, and Billy works as a waiter. By night, they perform at a local comedy club. It's a good thing they have each other, though, because their behavior tends to land them in incredibly awkward situations, and they're completely clueless as to why people dislike them or find them offensive. They don't hesitate, for example, to poll the other attendees at a funeral -- while the service is in progress -- to find a good place in the area for lunch. The 30-minute Hulu-original series is executive-produced by Amy Poehler (\"Parks and Recreation\") and Dave Becky (\"Louie\").",

But his best-friend/confidant Mike -- his polar opposite -- is a cool, confident bro with an expense account. Mike is also the proverbial devil on his buddy's shoulder, pushing him to engage in activities like sex and drugs. Also in Josh's life is his sister Liz, a corporate lawyer who wants him to get his act together. When Josh does finally find love, he tackles his toughest challenge to date: a serious, long-term relationship and all that comes with it, including anniversaries, merging friend groups, and learning to live their lives as a team.",

Dr. Algernon Edwards, recruited by hospital patron Capt. August Robertson, is the chief's professional equal, but Edwards' color skews Thackery's opinion -- until a chance discovery changes it. Co-executive produced by Steven Soderbergh, who directs the first season, \"The Knick\" is a sometimes-graphic drama, revealing racism and corruption while desperate people became operating-room guinea pigs.",

The documentary crew finds worthy subjects in cousins and best friends Kelly Mallet and Lloyd \"Shrub\" Mallet, who let the documentary crew in on their lives and local current events. Father Joe is the local minister who also attempts to guide Kelly and Shrub. He moved to Flatch with former girlfriend Cheryl Peterson, the editor of the local newspaper The Flatch Patriot. Other Flatch residents include Mickey St. Jean, who relentlessly attempts to become Shrub's best friend; Kelly's frenemy, Nadine Garcia-Parney, who runs the Flatch Historical Society; and Mandy Matthews, a magnetic force of nature who lives life on her own terms.",

Derek is in his 40s and is vulnerable to being ridiculed and ostracized because of his childlike nature, diminished intelligence and social awkwardness. Among his co-workers at the home are Dougie, his friend and landlord, and Hannah, his best friend who is smart and hard-working but unlucky in love.

It revolves around Abe Woodhull, a young farmer torn between loyalty to his Tory background and respect for those who fight for the Patriot cause. Living on British-occupied Long Island, Abe joins a group of his childhood friends to form what becomes known as the Culper Ring, a spy network charged with sniffing out British military strategy. Under the direction of Gen. Washington, Abe and his fellow agents help turn the war to the Continentals' favor, and their daring efforts ultimately serve as the foundation for modern espionage.",

And Pius XIII proves to be the most mysterious and contradictory of them all. As Belardo begins his reign, he is stubbornly resistant to the Vatican stewards, instead relying on Sister Mary to serve as his chief adviser. While she urges him to focus on leading his billion followers, the young pope shows little interest in making himself known, either to the College of Cardinals or to the masses.

As he struggles to adapt, Daniel is comforted by support from his younger sister, Amantha, who has always believed in his innocence and has worked her entire adult life to secure his release. Not so for Ted Jr., Daniel's stepbrother with whom he has no relationship. Insecure and manipulative, Ted is skeptical of Daniel's motives and will do anything to protect his family.",
