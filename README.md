## Description

WEBTOON is a South Korean webtoons publisher launched in 2004 by Naver Corporation. As one of the biggest webtoon platform in the world, the company provides webtoons in different languages, such as Indonesian. Webtoons released in Indonesian can be accessed from [webtoons.com/id](webtoons.com/id). 

The data provided in this project is scraped from [webtoons.com/id/genre](webtoons.com/id/genre), where you can see all the webtoons available on the website. I scraped data from 683 available official webtoons. I chose to scrap this platform as WEBTOON's popularity is steadily increasing because lots of webtoons from this platform are adapted to live actions and it is often talked about on social media. The data can help people interested in reading webtoons to know information about available webtoons on the most popular platform and might help them to make decisions in reading webtoons.

Data storing is done by importing the json file to MongoDB. I chose MongoDB because of a few reasons. First, it's easier to import json file to a MongoDB database because it is a document-oriented NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents. MongoDB is also faster and more scalable than SQL server. It is also a popular and widely used NoSQL database program. MongoDB also has MongoDB Atlas which help making a cluster 

## Specification

A few libraries are needed to run the scraper.

1. **BeautifulSoup4**  
   Main library needed to do web scraping. You need to install this library before using.
2. **Requests**  
   Library used to access websites and request objects from websites. You need to install this library before using.
3. **Time**  
   Library used to access sleep() function to prevent blocking.
4. **JSON**  
   Library used to write the data to a json file.
5. **OS**  
   Library used to read or write file in operating system.
6. **TQDM**  
   Library used to see progress bar in loops to monitor the scraping progress.
7. **LXML**  
   Library used to parse HTML because it is faster than html.parser. You need to install this library before using.

## How to Use

### Data Scraping
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install all required libraries (and Python if you haven't).
3. Open `scraper.py` in your IDE.
4. Change the path or json file name to your preference on variable `path`.
5. Run the code and the data will be stored in a json file on the chosen path.

### Data Storing
__Local__
1. Install **MongoDB Compass**.
2. Connect to your localhost (it is automatically provided so you just have to press **Connect**).
3. Create database and create collection.
4. Click **ADD DATA** and **Import File**.
5. Select the JSON file from the scraping process and press **IMPORT**

__MongoDB Atlas__
1. Open https://www.mongodb.com/atlas on your browser and **Sign In**.
2. Create a cluster. You can make one for free.
3. Press **Connect** on your cluster and pick the MongoDB Compass choice.
4. Copy the connection string and paste it to MongoDB Compass. Don't forget to add your username and password.
5. Connect to it and import file as explained in the Local part.
6. Open MongoDB Atlas and see collection in the cluster.
