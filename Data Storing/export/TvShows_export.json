After abandoning his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer's soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul.",

  "synopsis": "A humanoid horse, BoJack Horseman -- lost in a sea of self-loathing and booze -- decides it's time for a comeback. Once the star of a '90s sitcom, in which he was the adoptive father of three orphaned kids (two girls and a boy). The show was the hottest thing around, then suddenly, was canceled. Now 18 years later, BoJack wants to regain his dignity. With the aid of a human sidekick and a feline ex-girlfriend who is his agent, he sets out to make it happen. But Hollywood is vastly different from those days, and getting used to stuff like Twitter may take some time. This first animated series from Netflix -- with plenty of references to sex, drugs and alcohol -- is not for the little ones.",

Shrewd U.S. attorney Chuck Rhoades is embroiled in a high-stakes game of predator vs. prey with Bobby Axelrod, an ambitious hedge-fund king. To date, Rhoades has never lost an insider trading case -- he's 81-0 -- but when criminal evidence turns up against Axelrod, he proceeds cautiously in building the case against Axelrod, who employs Rhoades' wife, psychiatrist Wendy, as a performance coach for his company. Wendy, who has been in her position longer than Chuck has been in his, refuses to give up her career for her husband's legal crusade against Axelrod. Both men use their intelligence, power and influence to outmaneuver the other in this battle over billions. The high-profile cast is led by Emmy winner Paul Giamatti (\"John Adams\") as Chuck Rhoades.",

In 1882, young Marian Brook moves from rural Pennsylvania to New York City after the death of her father to live with her aunts Agnes van Rhijn and Ada Brook. Accompanied by Peggy Scott, an aspiring writer seeking a fresh start, Marian inadvertently becomes enmeshed in a social war between one of her aunts, a scion of the old money set, and her stupendously rich neighbors, a ruthless railroad tycoon and his ambitious wife, George and Bertha Russell. Exposed to a world on the brink of the modern age, Marian must choose if she will follow the established rules of society or forge her own path.",

He faces a constant barrage of life's little annoyances, which in David's sometimes well-meaning but terminally fumbling hands don't tend to stay small for very long. Episodes frequently center on his ignorance of or disregard for well-established social conventions and expectations, as well as his insistence that others adhere to rules of which only he seems to be aware. Developed from a 1999 one-hour special on HBO that was envisioned as a one-time project, the series premiered in October 2000.",

But the new living arrangement turns out to be a learning experience for everyone, punctuated, of course, by typical show devices (blind dates, one-night stands, parental visits, etc.) that lead to moments of hilarity, in between which nuggets of truth can be found.",

They live together in a Bay Area startup incubator loosely run by self-satisfied dot-com millionaire Erlich, who lets them stay in his house rent-free in exchange for a stake in the projects they invent there.

Now a nurse, Penelope is raising two strong-willed children. When faced with challenges, Penelope turns to her \"old-school\" mother, and her building manager, who has become an invaluable confidant. The series offers a contemporary take on what life looks like in both good and bad times, and how loved ones can help make it all worthwhile.",

His father urges him to buckle down and improve his grades (\"a C is a Jewish F!\" he tells his son, just before collapsing on the tennis court) so he can get into the college's CPA program. Trouble is, David isn't sure he wants to be a CPA. His boss recommends ditching college to go into the stock market. And on a personal level, though David is dating the hot aerobics instructor at the club, his eye wanders to the daughter of one of the club's tougher members (Getty, played by the normally likeable Paul Reiser), who refuses to shake the hands of any of the staff members. Summer won't last forever, though, and David has some decisions to make as he eventually moves on to the Big Apple.",

They're not sure what they want, or who they want it from, and the picture isn't getting any clearer. Hannah thinks she has what it takes to be a successful writer, if only she would write something. She wants a boyfriend without dealing with an actual relationship, and she wants a job without having to work. Marnie is Hannah's best friend, a Type A personality who has a serious boyfriend and an actual job. Jessa is a devil-may-care bohemian whose apparent lack of fear hides her own kind of insecurity. Her cousin, Shoshanna, is an NYU student who would love nothing more than to experience a \"Sex and the City\" lifestyle. The others tend to underestimate Shoshanna, but she proves to be a sharp source of wisdom.",

With the help of trained assassins like Sunny, the area is ruled by rival barons, and for decades Quinn has consistently outflanked and outmaneuvered his fellow barons to keep the upper hand. His invincibility, however, begins to fade in light of brazen attacks by the newest baron, The Widow, who believes M.K. is the key to her success.

The brilliant, obsessive Kreizler is known as an alienist -- one who studies mental pathologies and the deviant behaviors of those who are alienated from themselves and society. His job, along with his controversial views, makes him a social pariah in some circles. But helped by a band of outsiders, Kreizler's tireless efforts eventually answer the question behind what makes a man into a murderer.",

A cast of barkeeps, prostitutes, pimps, police and nightlife seekers centers around twins Vincent and Frankie Martino (James Franco, in a dual role), who navigate the sex business after meeting well-connected mobster Rudy Pipilo.

Or is he? The colorful and frequently profane sitcom comes from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, among others, and stars Danny McBride (\"Tropic Thunder\").",

When Patty files a lawsuit against McClaren -- whom Ellen has agreed to represent -- the judge in the custody case rules that Ellen cannot take the stand until the McClaren case is resolved.",

So it's a good thing he can rely on help from Fiona, his ex-girlfriend and IRA spy, and his friend Sam, also a former spy. Then there's Madeline, Michael's mother, a hypochondriac but probably not a spy.",

But the plan keeps changing and more questions surface as the survivors discover what they're really up against: a highly intelligent, heavily armed alien force whose purpose on Earth is the biggest mystery of all.",

As members of society's upper echelons and those on the marginalized fringes begin to question the so-called faultless rules of their reality, perfection gets flipped on its head. Based on Aldous Huxley's prophetic 1932 novel, this genre-bending, science-fiction and fantasy drama imagines a world steeped in holographic pleasure, with hedonistic values re-branded as selflessness for the good of the collective. In a pressure cooker of norms both strait-jacketed and freewheeling, humanity is on a collision course with forbidden love and revolutionary uprising.",

They target George Murcheson, an investor who has passed on the likes of Facebook, Foursquare and Pinterest. Unable to get an appointment with the man, they crash his party and demo their app, which his investment adviser proclaims a stalker's dream. Murcheson's money could make or break the guys' futures.

They don't hesitate, for example, to poll the other attendees at a funeral -- while the service is in progress -- to find a good place in the area for lunch.

Dr. Algernon Edwards, recruited by hospital patron Capt. August Robertson, is the chief's professional equal, but Edwards' color skews Thackery's opinion -- until a chance discovery changes it. Co-executive produced by Steven Soderbergh, who directs the first season, \"The Knick\" is a sometimes-graphic drama, revealing racism and corruption while desperate people became operating-room guinea pigs.",

The documentary crew finds worthy subjects in cousins and best friends Kelly Mallet and Lloyd \"Shrub\" Mallet, who let the documentary crew in on their lives and local current events. Father Joe is the local minister who also attempts to guide Kelly and Shrub. He moved to Flatch with former girlfriend Cheryl Peterson, the editor of the local newspaper The Flatch Patriot. Other Flatch residents include Mickey St. Jean, who relentlessly attempts to become Shrub's best friend; Kelly's frenemy, Nadine Garcia-Parney, who runs the Flatch Historical Society; and Mandy Matthews, a magnetic force of nature who lives life on her own terms.",

Under the direction of Gen. Washington, Abe and his fellow agents help turn the war to the Continentals' favor, and their daring efforts ultimately serve as the foundation for modern espionage.",

In the Vatican, however, the prevailing wisdom is the church's leaders have chosen a mysterious figure as their guiding force. And Pius XIII proves to be the most mysterious and contradictory of them all. As Belardo begins his reign, he is stubbornly resistant to the Vatican stewards, instead relying on Sister Mary to serve as his chief adviser. While she urges him to focus on leading his billion followers, the young pope shows little interest in making himself known, either to the College of Cardinals or to the masses. The 10-episode drama series stars Jude Law in the title role and Diane Keaton as Sister Mary, a nun from the U.S. now living in Vatican City.",

As the government races to understand the phenomenon, analyze the potential threat, and contain the story, an empathetic social worker and hardened community corrections officer are among the civil servants called upon to deal with the uncanny refugees. The new partners clash in ideology and approach but gradually find they have more in common than they thought as they become familiar with those under their care -- a group of unwilling time travelers who are grappling with their impossible new reality, including the fact that they were returned with a few upgrades, and the increasing likelihood that they were brought back now for a reason they're only beginning to understand.",
